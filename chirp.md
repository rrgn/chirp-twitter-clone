# Chirp

You will build Chirp.

Chirp is a social network that allows its users to read and write status updates - also called "chirps" - that are no longer than 141 characters long. User A can follow user B by clicking on the "Follow" button on user B's profile page, and there after user A will see user B's chirps in his own "timeline".

These are the main pages within the Chirp application:

1. The timeline page - the user sees his timeline, which consists of all chirps posted by users he is following, or himself.
2. The profile page - each user on the app has his own profile page. The profile page displays his most recent chirps, as well as his name, and a "Follow" button for other users to start following his chirps.
3. The login page
4. The user sign up page

## Suggestions on Planning Approach

The problem of breaking a project down to small parts is something you'll need to get practice with. Which is why I am letting you plan out the project on your own.

1. break it down to small parts
2. use the 80/20 rule to prioritize: what is the 20% of the work that will get me 80% of the a working app?
